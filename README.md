# WashingMachine - Padel Tennis Pairing App

A dynamic iOS app for padel tennis players that automatically pairs players into balanced teams and manages matches.

## Features

- **Dynamic Player Pairing**: Automatically pairs players based on skill level, creating balanced matches
- **Score Tracking**: Input match scores and track player performance
- **ELO Rating System**: Players' ratings change based on match results
- **Match Management**: Create, join, and manage padel tennis matches
- **User Profiles**: Personalized profiles with stats, match history, and skill ratings

## Technical Overview

### Architecture

The app is built with SwiftUI for iOS and uses Firebase for backend services:

- **Frontend**: SwiftUI
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (for profile pictures)
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging and Apple Push Notification Service

### Key Components

1. **Authentication System**
   - Email/password login
   - OAuth support (Apple, Google)
   - User profile management

2. **Match Management**
   - Create matches with configurable rules
   - Join existing matches
   - Public and private matches with invite codes

3. **Pairing Algorithm**

   - Avoids repeat pairings in the same match

4. **Score Tracking**
   - Set-by-set score input
   - Automatic winner determination
   - Player stats tracking

## Testing
